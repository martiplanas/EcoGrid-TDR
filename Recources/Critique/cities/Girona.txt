Girona, a city of around 100,000 people, is known for its medieval architecture and proximity to the Pyrenees and Costa Brava. 
Its historic center and riverbanks attract tourism, but the region is also experiencing the impacts of climate change, with more frequent heatwaves and droughts affecting agriculture and water supply.
