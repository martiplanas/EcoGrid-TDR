Barcelona, with over 1.6 million people in the city and around 5 million in the metropolitan area, is a hub of culture, tourism, and business in Catalonia. 
Its dense population, historical architecture, and seaside location make it vulnerable to issues like air pollution and rising sea levels. 
The city is also adapting to urban heat island effects, with efforts to green its streets and reduce car traffic.
