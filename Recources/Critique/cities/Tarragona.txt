Tarragona, with a population of around 135,000, is a coastal city known for its Roman heritage and port activities. 
It plays a significant role in Cataloniaâ€™s shipping and tourism sectors. 
However, its location makes it susceptible to rising sea levels and coastal erosion. 
The city is working on coastal protection projects and sustainable tourism practices to mitigate these impacts.
