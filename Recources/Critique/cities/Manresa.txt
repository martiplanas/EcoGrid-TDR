Manresa, with a population of roughly 77,000, is an industrial and historical hub in central Catalonia. 
The city’s economy is shaped by manufacturing and agriculture, but like many inland areas, it faces challenges from droughts and rising temperatures. 
The nearby Llobregat River is a crucial water source, but lower rainfall has impacted the region’s water availability.
