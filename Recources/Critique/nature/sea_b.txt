In open waters, climate change is reshaping ocean dynamics. 
Warmer temperatures are disrupting currents, which play a crucial role in distributing heat and nutrients. 
Fish populations are shifting, with some species migrating to cooler waters, leaving traditional fishing zones barren. 
The increased CO2 is also acidifying the water, weakening coral reefs and shellfish populations. 
Mid-sea ecosystems are delicate, and small changes in temperature or chemistry ripple across the entire marine food chain.
