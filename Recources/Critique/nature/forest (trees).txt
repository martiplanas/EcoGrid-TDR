Forests absorb around 30% of the CO2 we release into the atmosphere, making them critical in the fight against climate change. 
But deforestation is wiping out this natural defense. 
Logging, agriculture, and urban expansion are shrinking forests at an alarming rate, releasing stored carbon back into the atmosphere. 
This not only accelerates global warming but also threatens biodiversity and water cycles. 
Protecting forests isn’t just about conservation; it’s about maintaining the planet’s ability to regulate its own climate. 
The more trees we lose, the harder the fight becomes.
