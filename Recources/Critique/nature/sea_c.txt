The deep sea, largely unexplored, is not immune to climate change. 
Rising temperatures are creeping into these abyssal depths, altering ecosystems that have remained stable for millennia. 
The deep sea’s ability to store carbon is being compromised, while deep-sea mining and trawling threaten to disrupt habitats before we even fully understand them. 
These hidden ecosystems, though distant, play a crucial role in regulating the Earth’s climate. 
As we alter the surface, the deep sea becomes the last line of defense—but even that is now at risk.
