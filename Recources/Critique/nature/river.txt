Rivers are the lifeblood of ecosystems and human societies, but they are shrinking under the weight of climate change. 
In Catalonia, prolonged droughts are becoming more common, reducing water flow and leaving reservoirs at critically low levels. 
As temperatures rise, evaporation increases, while rainfall becomes unpredictable, often too little or arriving as sudden floods. 
These shifts strain agriculture, drinking water supplies, and energy generation. 
When rivers dry up, it's not just a local issueâ€”food security and economic stability are also at stake.
