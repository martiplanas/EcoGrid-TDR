Coastal ecosystems, like mangroves and salt marshes, are key players in carbon storage, absorbing CO2 and buffering storms. 
But rising sea levels, driven by climate change, are eroding coastlines and drowning these habitats. 
Human activities like pollution and overfishing only worsen the problem. 
As coastal waters warm, marine species migrate or die off, destabilizing local economies that rely on fishing. 
Coastal regions are at the frontline of climate change, where human and environmental vulnerability collide.
