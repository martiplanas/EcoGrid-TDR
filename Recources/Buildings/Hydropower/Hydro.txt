How it Works:
Hydropower plants use the energy of flowing water, typically from a dam, to turn turbines. The movement of the water spins the turbines, which activates generators to produce electricity.

Benefits:
Generates electricity from flowing water, a renewable resource.
Highly efficient and capable of providing a continuous energy supply.
Can help with water management and flood control.

Downsides:
Can disrupt local ecosystems and fish migration.
High initial construction costs and potential displacement of communities.
Dependent on water availability, which can be affected by droughts and climate change.
