How it Works:
Solar panels capture sunlight and convert it into electricity using photovoltaic cells. They work best in sunny conditions and can be installed on rooftops or in large solar farms.

Benefits:
- Harnesses energy from the sun, a renewable and abundant resource.
- Produces no emissions during operation, reducing carbon footprint.
- Low maintenance and scalable for various applications.

Downsides:
- Energy production is weather-dependent and varies with time of day.
- High initial installation costs.
- Requires significant space for large-scale energy generation.
