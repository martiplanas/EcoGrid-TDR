How it Works:
Wind turbines use the kinetic energy of the wind to turn large blades connected to a rotor. The rotor spins a generator to produce electricity. Wind farms can be located on land or offshore.

Benefits:
- Utilizes wind, a clean and renewable resource.
- Produces no emissions during operation, contributing to cleaner air.
- Can be installed onshore and offshore, providing flexibility.

Downsides:
- Energy production is intermittent and depends on wind availability.
- Can impact local wildlife, particularly birds and bats.
- Noise and visual impact can be a concern for nearby communities.
