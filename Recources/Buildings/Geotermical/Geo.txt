How it Works:
Geothermal plants extract heat from beneath the Earth's surface. This heat is used to produce steam, which drives turbines connected to generators, producing electricity.

Benefits:
Taps into the Earth's internal heat, providing a stable and renewable energy source.
Low greenhouse gas emissions and small land footprint.
Reliable and capable of supplying base-load power.

Downsides:
High initial costs for drilling and plant construction.
Limited to regions with suitable geothermal activity.
Potential for land subsidence and release of harmful gases during extraction.
