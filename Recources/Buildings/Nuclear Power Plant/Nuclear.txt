How it Works:
Nuclear power plants generate electricity through nuclear fission, where uranium atoms are split to release energy. This heat is used to produce steam, which drives turbines to generate power.

Benefits:
- Generates a continuous and reliable supply of electricity.
- Produces minimal greenhouse gas emissions during operation.
- High energy density, meaning a small amount of fuel produces a lot of energy.

Downsides:
- Produces radioactive waste that requires long-term management.
- Risk of catastrophic accidents with severe environmental and health impacts.
- High construction and decommissioning costs.
