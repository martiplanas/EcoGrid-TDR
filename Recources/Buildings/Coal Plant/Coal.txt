How it Works:
Coal power plants burn coal to heat water, producing steam that drives turbines connected to generators. This process converts the energy from burning coal into electricity.

Benefits:
Provides reliable, large-scale energy production.  
Can meet high energy demands with stable output, ensuring base-load power.  
Infrastructure is well-established in many regions.

Downsides:
Major source of CO2 emissions, driving climate change.  
Releases harmful pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, affecting air quality.  
Coal extraction damages ecosystems, and long-term dependence locks in environmental harm.
